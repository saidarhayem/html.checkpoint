<h1> Life and career</<h1>
  <p> Tamer Hosny was born in Cairo to an Egyptian father and Syrian mother. Unlike his father, Hosny Sherif Abbas, Tamer Hosny grew up with an interest in football and played the sport for five years.[3] Tamer Hosny had his first directorial experience in 2010 when directing his music video "Se7eet 3la Sotha" (Woke up to her voice). Hosny had a long-held ambition to become a director and to make his own music video.[4] He starred in the 2003 Egyptian film Halet Hob (A State of Love).[5] In 2006, he was arrested for forging military papers to avoid military conscription. He received a one-year prison sentence, yet he only stayed in jail for six months.[6]

    In 2010, he released the comedy-drama film The Light of My Eyes. The movie was placed first on the Arabian box office after a week of its release.[7]
    
    In 2012, he released Omar & Salma 3, the third sequel to the Omar & Salma trilogy. Hosny has frequently stated that he was not satisfied with the film. In a recent interview on the Set El Hosn (Beautiful lady) program, he admitted that "I'm not happy with how the movie turned out, although many people love it and it was a box office success. I don't blame anyone else for that. I take responsibility for it. We had to make major plot changes due to financial reasons."[8]
    
    After three years away from the movie industry, he released Ahwak alongside Ghada Adel and Ahmed Malek, a romantic comedy about a young plastic surgeon who falls in love with a divorced woman. The film was a success at the box office, with total revenue of 22 million Egyptian pounds.[9]
    
    In 2017, Hosny released Tesbah ala Kher (Good Night), a comedy drama about a wealthy entrepreneur who suffers from depression and hallucinations. Falcon Films – the film distributor in the Arab world – released an official statement announcing that the movie has topped the Arabic box office.[10][11]
    
    In 2018, Hosny released a new comedy El-Badlah. In 2019, Hosny released a new thriller comedy El Feloos (The Money).[12] It grossed more than EGP 46 million in the Egyptian box office in a little over a month, while it reaped almost USD 2 million worldwide. In December 2019, Hosny broke the Guinness World Record for the most contributions to a bulletin board.[13]
    
    In 2021, Hosny released his new comedy-drama Mesh Ana.[14][15] The film is written by Hosny, directed by Sarah Wafik, and produced by Synergy and HS production</p>
